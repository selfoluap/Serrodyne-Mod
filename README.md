# Overview

Simple tool to calculate and visualize generated frequency offsets by using serrodyne modulation. The tool allows to create sequences of ramps with different slopes which allow to generate arbitrary time-sequenced line spectra. Methods are based on the idea of this paper: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/82/7/073107/354324/Creation-of-arbitrary-time-sequenced-line-spectra
